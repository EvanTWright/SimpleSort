# Simple Sort (Python)
For this program to run you will need 2 things.
1. Python 3 installed(preferably the lastest version)
2. Python to be present in your PATH. 

## Instructions to see sorted list:    
Once cloned locally from git, navigate to the directory SortPython within the shell on MacOS, linux, or windows. 
From here run "python print_sort.py" 

## Instructions to test list is correctly sorted:
Once cloned locally from git, navigate to the directory SortPython within the shell on MacOS, linux, or windows. 
From here run "python test_sort.py" 

Running "python call_sort.py" will return the sorted list but not output anything to the terminal. 
The output is the contents of the text file sorted.
